- **Simulation Agent**: Simulates the scenarios based on the data analysis.
- **Reporting Agent**: Generates a report based on the simulation results.

### Sample Questions

1. Revenue summary
   Show total estimated revenue across all accounts in January 2025.

2. Top 5 high-balance accounts
   List the top 5 account names by available balance.

3. Dormant accounts
   Which customers have dormant accounts?

4. Balance trend comparison
   Compare average balances between January 1st and January 31st, 2025 for each account.

5. Rate vs Revenue correlation
   Find account names where deposit rate is above 5% and show their daily estimated revenue performance.

6. Customer portfolio size
   Show customers with multiple accounts and their combined available balance across all accounts.

7. Rate Impact Simulation
   If we raise deposit rates by 0.5% to match market average, how will it affect our interest expense and customer growth potential?

8. Selective Rate Increase
   What if we applied a 0.3% rate increase only to accounts that showed positive balance growth in January - what would be the revenue impact?
