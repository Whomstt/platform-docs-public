With the club heading for administration, he was sold on to First Division rivals Port Vale for \u00a3300,000 in January 1999, as one of long-term manager John Rudge's last purchases. In October 1999, he was sold on to league rivals Sheffield United for \u00a3375,000, with Bell eager to cash in on the \u00a375,000 profit. He was then sold on to promotion chasing Blackburn Rovers for \u00a32 million in November 2000; the transfer was seen as good business for both clubs. Ipswich then found another striking talent, Darren Bent (no relation), and Bent joined newly promoted Premier League side Leicester City on loan for the 2003\u201304 campaign, in a move that reunited him with manager Micky Adams. Unable to afford his \u00a317,000-per-week contract, in June 2004, Ipswich sold Bent to Everton for a fee of \u00a3450,000; \"the Toffees\" manager David Moyes said that \"he's got athleticism, he's quick, good in the air\". In January 2006, it was announced that Bent had signed for Charlton Athletic in a deal worth \u00a32.3 million. Bent joined Wigan Athletic on \"Transfer Deadline Day\" (31 August 2007) on a season-long loan move, one of nine summer signings by boss Chris Hutchings. Bent signed a three-year deal for Birmingham City in July 2008 for a fee in excess of \u00a31\u00a0million, after rejecting the opportunity to join Cardiff City. Instead, he became Gordon Strachan's first signing for Middlesbrough when he joined on a two-month loan deal on 30 October 2009, later extended to 16 January 2010. He spent the final three months of the 2009\u201310 season on loan at a second Championship club, Queens Park Rangers, whom he joined in February 2010. Still out of the first team plans at St Andrew's, he again moved on loan in August 2010, as he joined Mick McCarthy's Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers until 4 January 2011.

{"premise":"Though not a prolific striker for Brentford, Bent's potential was spotted by Crystal Palace manager Steve Coppell, who brought Bent to Selhurst Park for \u00a3300,000 in January 1998. With the club heading for administration, he was sold on to First Division rivals Port Vale for \u00a3300,000 in January 1999, as one of long-term manager John Rudge's last purchases. In October 1999, he was sold on to league rivals Sheffield United for \u00a3375,000, with Bell eager to cash in on the \u00a375,000 profit. He was then sold on to promotion chasing Blackburn Rovers for \u00a32 million in November 2000; the transfer was seen as good business for both clubs. Ipswich then found another striking talent, Darren Bent (no relation), and Bent joined newly promoted Premier League side Leicester City on loan for the 2003\u201304 campaign, in a move that reunited him with manager Micky Adams. Unable to afford his \u00a317,000-per-week contract, in June 2004, Ipswich sold Bent to Everton for a fee of \u00a3450,000; \"the Toffees\" manager David Moyes said that \"he's got athleticism, he's quick, good in the air\". In January 2006, it was announced that Bent had signed for Charlton Athletic in a deal worth \u00a32.3 million. Bent joined Wigan Athletic on \"Transfer Deadline Day\" (31 August 2007) on a season-long loan move, one of nine summer signings by boss Chris Hutchings. Bent signed a three-year deal for Birmingham City in July 2008 for a fee in excess of \u00a31\u00a0million, after rejecting the opportunity to join Cardiff City. Instead, he became Gordon Strachan's first signing for Middlesbrough when he joined on a two-month loan deal on 30 October 2009, later extended to 16 January 2010. He spent the final three months of the 2009\u201310 season on loan at a second Championship club, Queens Park Rangers, whom he joined in February 2010.
