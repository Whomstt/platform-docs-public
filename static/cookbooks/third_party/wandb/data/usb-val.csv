Smith maxed out more than a dozen credit cards, and sold his much-treasured comic book collection, to raise $27,575 to make the film, while saving money by casting friends and acquaintances in most roles. ""Clerks"" was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994, where it won the Filmmaker's Trophy. Widely hailed as Smith's best film, 1997's ""Chasing Amy"" marked what Quentin Tarantino called ""a quantum leap forward"" for Smith. Smith's fourth film, ""Dogma"" (1999), featured an all-star cast and was mired in controversy. In the 2006 sequel ""Clerks II"", Smith revisited the Dante and Randal characters from his first film in his final visit to the View Askewniverse. In 2017, due to obstacles getting ""Clerks 3"" or ""Mallrats 2"" produced, Smith decided to write and direct a ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" sequel instead, ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot"". As an actor, Smith is best known for his role as Silent Bob in ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"", ""Chasing Amy"", ""Dogma"", ""Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back"", and ""Clerks II""."
