## Start using Mistral AI API

To get started with Mistral AI, you need to create an account and set up your payment information; once done you can create an API key and start using our API.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="account-setup">Account Setup</SectionTab>

- Create a Mistral account or sign in at https://console.mistral.ai.
- Then, navigate to your "Organization" settings at https://admin.mistral.ai.
- To add your payment information and activate payments on your account, find the [billing](https://admin.mistral.ai/organization/billing) section under Administration.
  - You may be later prompted to select a plan; pick between Experiment (free experimental tier) and Scale (pay as you go) plans.
- You can now manage all your [Workspaces](https://admin.mistral.ai/organization/workspaces) and Organization via this page.
- Return to https://console.mistral.ai once everything is settled.
- After that, go to the [API keys](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys) page under your Workspace and create a new API key by clicking "Create new key". Make sure to copy the API key, save it securely, and do not share it with anyone.
