Once your agent is created, you can **start** conversations at any point while keeping the same conversation persistent. You first start a conversation by providing:
- `agent_id`: The ID of the agent, created during the Agent creation.
- `inputs`: The message to start the conversation with. It can be either a string with the first user message or question, or the history of messages.  

Creating a Conversation will return a conversation ID.

To **continue** the conversation and append the exchanges as you go, you provide two values:
- `conversation_id`: The ID created during the conversation start or append that maps to the internally stored conversation history.
- `inputs`: The next message or reply. It can be either a string or a list of messages.  

A new Conversation ID is provided at each append.

You can also **opt out** from the automatic storing with `store=False`; this will make the new history not being stored on our cloud.  

We also provide the parameter `handoff_execution`, which currently has two modes: `server` or `client`.
- `server`: Runs the handoff as expected internally on our cloud servers; this is the default setting.
- `client`: When a handoff is triggered, a response is provided directly to the user, enabling them to handle the handoff with control.  

For more information regarding handoffs visit [this section](../handoffs).
