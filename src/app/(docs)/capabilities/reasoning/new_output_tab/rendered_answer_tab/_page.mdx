To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information and the relationships between the ages of the sisters and John.

1. The first sister is currently 4 years old.
2. Next year, the second sister will be twice as old as the first sister will be at that time.
3. The third sister is two years older than the second sister.
4. The third sister is half the age of her older brother, John.

Let's denote the current ages of the sisters and John as follows:

- \( S_1 \): Age of the first sister
- \( S_2 \): Age of the second sister
- \( S_3 \): Age of the third sister
- \( J \): Age of John

From the given information:

- \( S_1 = 4 \)
- Next year, the second sister will be twice as old as the first sister will be next year. Therefore, next year, the first sister will be \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) years old, and the second sister will be \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) years old. This means the current age of the second sister is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) years old.
- The third sister is two years older than the second sister, so \( S_3 = 9 + 2 = 11 \) years old.
- The third sister is half the age of her older brother, John. Therefore, \( J = 2 \times 11 = 22 \) years old.

Thus, the age of John is \(\boxed{22}\).
