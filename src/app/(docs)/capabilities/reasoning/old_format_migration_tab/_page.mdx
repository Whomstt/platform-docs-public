The old format had the thinking chunks and the final answer within the same content type, making it harder to parse the input/output.

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "System prompt, with both instructions and\n<think>\nEncapsulated reasoning instructions.\n</think>\n"
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "User input."
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "<think>\nReasoning traces.\n</think>\nFollowed by the final answer."
  }
]
```
