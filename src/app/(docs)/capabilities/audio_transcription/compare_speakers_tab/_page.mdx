Which speaker do you prefer between the two? Why? How are they different from each other?

**Assistant**

The speaker who delivers the farewell address is more engaging and inspiring.  
They express gratitude and optimism, emphasizing the importance of self-government and citizenship.  
They also share personal experiences and observations, making the speech more relatable and heartfelt.  
In contrast, the second speaker provides factual information about the weather in Barcelona, which is less engaging and lacks the emotional depth of the first speaker's address.
