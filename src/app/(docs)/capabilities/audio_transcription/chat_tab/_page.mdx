Sure, here is the transcription of what you said:  
"Today on July 15th, 2025, Mistral AI is announcing the new Voxtral models."  
And here is the Python code to generate the first n digits of the Fibonacci sequence:  
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

fib_sequence = [0, 1]
for i in range(2, n):
    next_value = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
    fib_sequence.append(next_value)

return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 10  # Change this value to get the first n digits of the Fibonacci sequence
print(fibonacci(n))
```
This code defines a function `fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list containing the first `n` digits of the Fibonacci sequence. You can change the value of `n` to get the desired number of Fibonacci digits.
