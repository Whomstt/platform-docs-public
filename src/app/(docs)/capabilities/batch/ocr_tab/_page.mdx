A batch file for OCR, would look like the following:

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="file" label="Batch File" default>

```bash

As a JSONL file, each line represents a request to the API Endpoint and Model.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="ocr-explained">Explanation</SectionTab>

The body request will follow the same format as the endpoint you want to run your batching, except the model id that will be provided only during the job creation to start the batch run. Below we provide an example of row with OCR:

```py
{
    "custom_id": "2", # An ID as metadata that will be returned in the output file to identify the request
    "body": { # The body of the request
        "document": { # The document to be processed
            "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,<base64_image>" # Here, we are using a base64 encoded image, but you can also use a URL to a file, and document_url for pdf or other kinds of documents
        }
    }
}
```
