Summarization is a common task for LLMs due to their natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Here is an example prompt we can use to generate interesting questions about an essay and summarize the essay.

#### Strategies we used:

- **Step-by-step instructions**: This strategy is inspired by the chain-of-thought prompting that enables LLMs to use a series of intermediate reasoning steps to tackle complex tasks. It's often easier to solve complex problems when we decompose them into simpler and small steps and it's easier for us to debug and inspect the model behavior. In our example, we break down the task into three steps: summarize, generate interesting questions, and write a report. This helps the language to think in each step and generate a more comprehensive final report.
- **Example generation**: We can ask LLMs to automatically guide the reasoning and understanding process by generating examples with the explanations and steps. In this example, we ask the LLM to generate three questions and provide detailed explanations for each question.
- **Output formatting**: We can ask LLMs to output in a certain format by directly asking "write a report in the Markdown format".
