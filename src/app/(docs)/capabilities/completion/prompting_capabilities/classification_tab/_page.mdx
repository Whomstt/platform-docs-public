Mistral models can easily **categorize text** into distinct classes. Take a customer support bot for a bank as an illustration: we can establish a series of predetermined categories within the prompt and then instruct Mistral AI models to categorize the customer's question accordingly.

In the following example, when presented with the customer inquiry, Mistral AI models correctly categorizes it as "country_support":

User Inquiry: "I am inquiring about the availability of your cards in the EU, as I am a resident of France and am interested in using your cards."
Assistant Response: "country_support"

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="classification-prompt">System Prompt</SectionTab>

The classification prompt needed to be carefully designed to ensure that the model correctly categorizes the customer inquiry.
For classification purposes, there are 2 main strategies, you could:
- Ask for the label directly, the model should then answer with a single word or string.
  - Effective, fast and cheap, this strategy will use the less amount of output tokens but may lack reliability and flexibility.
- Ask for a json output, the model should then answer with a json object that could be downstream processed easily.
  - Reliable, flexible and practical, this strategy will generate slightly more tokens but allows for more complex use cases and more flexibility.
