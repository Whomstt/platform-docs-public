Here's an example of how to use the `Frequency Penalty` parameter in the API:

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>

```py
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
model = "ministral-3b-latest"

client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user",
        "content": "List 10 possible titles for a fantasy book. Give a list only."}
        ],
    temperature=0,
    frequency_penalty=2
)

print(chat_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="output" label="output">

```
1. "The Shattered Crown"
2. "Whispers of the Old Magic"
3. "Echoes of Eternity"
4. "The Forgotten Realm"
5. "Shadows of the Lost City"
6. "Chronicles of the Enchanted Forest"
7. The Last Dragon's Roar
8."The Veil Between Worlds"
9."The Song of the Siren's Call"
10."Legends in Stone"
```

     </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> The output is already more diverse than previously, however notice that after the 7th value of the list tokens such as `_"` and single quotation marks start to also be heavily affected, this shows how stronger the impact of frequency penalty is in the long term as an accumulative penalty.
