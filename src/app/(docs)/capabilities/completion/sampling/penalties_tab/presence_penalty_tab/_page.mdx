import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@/components/common/multi-codeblock';

Here's an example of how to use the `Presence Penalty` parameter in the API:

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>

```py
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
model = "ministral-3b-latest"

client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user",
        "content": "List 10 possible titles for a fantasy book. Give a list only."}
        ],
    temperature=0,
    presence_penalty=2
)

print(chat_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="output" label="output">

```text
1. "The Shattered Crown"
2. "Whispers of the Old Magic"
3. "Echoes of Eternity"
4. "Shadows of the Forgotten Realm"
5. "Chronicles of the Enchanted Forest"
6. "The Last Dragon's Roar"
7. "Mysteries of the Hidden City"
8. "Legends of the Lost Kingdom"
9. "The Whispering Winds"
10. "The Unseen War"
```

     </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> The output list is already slightly different than the first one, being impacted by the presence penalty of present tokens. For instance we have less `The` as a token compared to without presence penalty.
