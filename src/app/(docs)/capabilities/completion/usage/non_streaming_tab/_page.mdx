For non-streaming chat completions requests, you will provid a list of messages and the model will return a **single full completion response**.
This response will contain the full completion **until the model decides to stop or the maximum number of tokens is reached**, important to know that the **longer the output and full completion, the higher the latency**.

Note that the response content of the model can have **interleaved events** instead of a single string, such as [citations](./citations) and [tool calls](./function-calling).  
The content can be either a string, the most standard usage of llms:
- `{'content': '...'}`  

...or a list of different types of contents:
- `{'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': '...'}, {'type': '...', '...': [...]}, ...]}`.

However, here are some of the most **iconic, beloved, and award-winning French cheeses**, each celebrated for its unique qualities:\n\n### **Top Contenders for \"Best\" French Cheese**\n1. **ComtÃ©** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** A versatile, nutty, and complex **alpine cheese** aged 4 months to 3+ years. Younger ComtÃ© is mild and buttery; aged versions develop crystalline crunch and deep caramelized flavors.\n   - **Best for:** Cheese boards, fondue, grilled cheese, or eating plain.\n   - **Fun fact:** Made in the Jura Mountains, each wheel is unique based on the terroir and aging.\n\n2. **Roquefort** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** The **king of blue cheeses**, made from sheepâ€™s milk and aged in natural caves. Creamy, tangy, and intensely flavorful with a sharp, salty bite.\n   - **Best for:** Spread on bread with honey or pears, in salads, or sauces.\n   - **Fun fact:** One of the oldest cheeses in France (mentioned by Pliny the Elder in 79 AD).\n\n3. **Camembert de Normandie** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** The **quintessential French cheese**â€”creamy, earthy, and slightly mushroomy when ripe. Invented in 1791 by Marie Harel.\n   - **Best for:** Baked (Camembert en croÃ»te), with crusty bread, or apples.\n   - **Pro tip:** Eat it at room temperature when the center is soft but not runny.\n\n4. **Ã‰poisses de Bourgogne** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** A **pungent, washed-rind cheese** with a velvety texture and bold, barnyardy flavor. Napoleon reportedly loved it.\n   - **Best for:** Spreading on bread or pairing with Burgundy wine.\n   - **Warning:** So strong itâ€™s banned on French public transport!\n\n5. **Reblochon** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** The **star of tartiflette**â€”creamy, nutty, and slightly smoky. Made in the Alps with raw cowâ€™s milk.\n   - **Best for:** Melting in tartiflette, raclette, or on potatoes.\n\n6. **Brie de Meaux** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** The **\"King of Cheeses\"** (as declared at the 1815 Congress of Vienna). Rich, buttery, and mushroomy with a soft rind.\n   - **Best for:** Pairing with Champagne or fruit (grapes, figs).\n\n7. **Munster (Munster-GÃ©romÃ©)** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** A **stinky, washed-rind cheese** from Alsace with a creamy, tangy interior. Often served with cumin.\n   - **Best for:** Melting in tarts or eating with beer.\n\n8. **Beaufort** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** A **firm, nutty alpine cheese** similar to GruyÃ¨re but richer. Aged versions are caramelized and complex.\n   - **Best for:** Fondue, gratins, or shaving over salads.\n\n9. **PÃ©lardon** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** A **small, tangy goat cheese** from the CÃ©vennes or Provence. Comes in fresh (soft) or aged (firm, peppery) varieties.\n   - **Best for:** Salads, tartines, or grilled with herbs.\n\n10. **Bleu dâ€™Auvergne** (AOP)\n   - **Why?** A **creamy, spicy blue cheese** with a sharper taste than Roquefort but less crumbly.\n   - **Best for:** Dressings, burgers, or cheese plates with walnuts.\n\n### **How to Choose?**\n- **Mild & creamy?** â†’ Brie de Meaux, Camembert, Saint-AndrÃ©.\n- **Bold & stinky?** â†’ Ã‰poisses, Munster, Pont-lâ€™Ã‰vÃªque.\n- **Nutty & firm?** â†’ ComtÃ©, Beaufort, Cantal.\n- **Blue cheese lover?** â†’ Roquefort, Bleu dâ€™Auvergne.\n- **Goat cheese fan?** â†’ Crottin de Chavignol, PÃ©lardon, ValenÃ§ay.\n\n### **Pro Tips for Enjoying French Cheese**\n- **Serve at room temperature** (take it out of the fridge 1â€“2 hours before eating).\n- **Pair with wine**: Brie + Champagne, Roquefort + Sauternes, ComtÃ© + Jura wine.\n- **Avoid plastic wrap**â€”store in cheese paper or a breathable container.\n- **Visit a *fromagerie*** in France for expert recommendations!\n\n### **Final Verdict**\nIf forced to pick **one \"best\"**, **ComtÃ©** (aged 24+ months) and **Roquefort** are often crowned for their depth and versatility. But the true joy of French cheese is in the **diversity**â€”so try them all!\n\n**Whatâ€™s your favorite?** ðŸ˜ŠðŸ§€"
