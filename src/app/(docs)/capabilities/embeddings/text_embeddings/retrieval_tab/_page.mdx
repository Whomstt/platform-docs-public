Our embedding model excels in retrieval tasks, as it is trained with retrieval in mind. Embeddings are also incredibly helpful in implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which use retrieved relevant information from a knowledge base to generate responses. At a high-level, we embed a knowledge base, whether it is a local directory, text files, or internal wikis, into text embeddings and store them in a vector database. Then, based on the user's query, we retrieve the most similar embeddings, which represent the relevant information from the knowledge base. Finally, we feed these relevant embeddings to a large language model to generate a response that is tailored to the user's query and context.
