Another potential use case is paraphrase detection. In this simple example, we have a list of three sentences, and we would like to find out if any of the two sentences are paraphrases of each other. If the distance between two sentence embeddings is small, it suggests that the two sentences are semantically similar and could be potential paraphrases.

The result suggests that the first two sentences are semantically similar and could be potential paraphrases, whereas the third sentence is more different. This is just a super simple example. But this approach can be extended to more complex situations in real-world applications, such as detecting paraphrases in social media posts, news articles, or customer reviews.
