For this section, we will leverage the previous **Batching and Classification examples** with the same disease dataset.

What if we don't have disease labels? One approach to gain insights from the data is through clustering. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their similarity with respect to certain features. In the context of text embeddings, we can use the distance between each embedding as a measure of similarity, and group together data points with embeddings that are close to each other in the high-dimensional space.

Since we already know there are 24 clusters, let's use the K-means clustering with 24 clusters. Then we can inspect a few examples and verify whether the examples in a single cluster are similar to one another. For example, take a look at the first three rows of cluster 23. We can see that they look very similar in terms of symptoms.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

model = KMeans(n_clusters=24, max_iter=1000)
model.fit(df['embeddings'].to_list())
df["cluster"] = model.labels_
print(*df[df.cluster==23].text.head(3), sep='\n\n')

I have been feeling extremely tired and weak, and I've also been coughing a lot with difficulty breathing. My fever is very high, and I'm producing a lot of mucus when I cough.
I've got a cough that won't go away, and I'm exhausted. I've been coughing up thick mucous and my fever is also pretty high.
I have a persistent cough and have been feeling quite fatigued. My fever is through the roof, and I'm having trouble breathing. When I cough, I also cough up a lot of mucous.
