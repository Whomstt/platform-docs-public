Conversational text only data between user and assistant, which can be one-turn or multi-turn.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "User interaction n째1"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Bot interaction n째1"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "User interaction n째2"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Bot interaction n째2"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Conversational data must be stored under the `"messages"` key as a list.
- Each list item is a dictionary containing the `"content"` and `"role"` keys. `"role"` is a string: `"system"`, `"user"`, `"assistant"` or `"tool"`.
- Loss computation is performed only on tokens corresponding to assistant messages (`"role" == "assistant"`).

While text-only fine-tuning covers multiple use cases, you can also fine-tune the vision capabilities of our models. This allows you to create models that can understand and generate responses based on both text and image inputs.
