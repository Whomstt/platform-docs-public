The chart is a bar chart titled 'France's Social Divide,' comparing socio-economic indicators between disadvantaged areas and the whole of France. It comprises two sections: the first section includes three bar groups representing the percentage of people part of the working-class, unemployment rate, and percentage of 16-25-year-olds not in school and unemployed. The second section includes three bar groups representing median monthly income, poverty rate, and households living in overcrowded housing. Each bar group contains two bars: one for disadvantaged areas (red) and one for the whole of France (blue). The data indicate that disadvantaged areas have higher percentages of working-class individuals (33.5% vs. 14.5%), unemployment (18.1% vs. 7.3%), and young people not in school and unemployed (25.2% vs. 12.9%). They also show a lower median monthly income (€1,168 vs. €1,822), a higher poverty rate (43.3% vs. 15.5%), and a higher percentage of households living in overcrowded housing (22.0% vs. 8.7%). The chart highlights significant disparities in socio-economic conditions between disadvantaged areas and the rest of France, emphasizing the challenges faced by these communities.
