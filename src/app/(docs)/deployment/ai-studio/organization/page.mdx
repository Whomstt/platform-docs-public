# Organizations & Workspaces

Mistral AI Studio offers two levels of access control: **Organizations** and **Workspaces**.

An **Organization** is the highest level of access. When you create an account, a default organization is created automatically. Depending on your company email address, you may be prompted to join an existing organization. Organization admins can invite other Mistral AI users to join.

Admins can manage the following at the organization level:
- Billing for all Workspaces
- Subscriptions
- General usage limits
- Organization member seats
- And more...

A **Mistral AI Studio Workspace** is a group of accounts within the same organization, each with specific rights and permissions. Creating a workspace for your team allows you to:
- Manage access and costs within the Workspace
- Share fine-tuned models and datasets among team members
- And more...

:::tip
When you generate an API key from your workspace and use it to create a fine-tuned model, upload a dataset, or perform other cloud operations, your team members will also have access to these resources.
This ensures that everything is accessible and usable by all authorized team members, making collaboration easier.

On the other hand, only certain members with sufficient permissions are allowed to create Workspaces and manage them. If you have such permissions, you can create a workspace as indicated below by visiting the [Admin page](https://admin.mistral.ai) or following the previous step (2). Under **Workspaces (1)**, click **"New Workspace" (2)**.
