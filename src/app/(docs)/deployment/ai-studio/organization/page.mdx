# Workspaces

A AI Studio workspace is a collective of accounts, each with a designated set of rights and permissions. Creating a workspace for your team enables you to:
- Manage access and costs
- Share fine-tuneds models among team members 

:::tip[ ]
When you generate an API key from your organization's workspace and use it to create a fine-tuned model, 
your team members will be able to use this model. 
This ensures that the model is accessible and usable by all authorized team members.
